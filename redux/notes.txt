index .js

create provider
create store
invoke or apply middleware middleware and connect store
connect store with reducer
connect
dispatch
create reducer and get data

create store folder
create action and recuers  sub folders
Rule is to have a index .js both in action and reducer 
which manages entire functionality.

in actions  have the method with action and payload.
in reducers have an index which combiners and manages all the reducers
and in specfic reducers we can have the switch logic to manage different actions .


componenet which invokes action in this case its the header will have a connection object from redux
which connect action and reducers with redux.

{ movies && movies.movieData.actors ? movies.movieData.actors.map(item =>(
      <div key={item.actors}>
      name :{item.actors}
      </div>
    )) :null}


    { users && users.getUsers ? users.getUsers.map(item =>(
      <div key={item.id}>
      Name :{item.name}
      </div>
    )) :null}
